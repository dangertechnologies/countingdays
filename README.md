# Counting Days

Counting Days is an iOS app (and can easily be compiled as an Android app) for creating countdowns.

It will then try to find some photos taken the same time _ago_ as the time that's left to show a time perspective, because sometimes time perception forward in time is easier to understand when compared to the same time backwards in time.

## Contributing
